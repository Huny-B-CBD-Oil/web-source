  I started using the Heated Hemp Liniment Bar on my feet. 
  I have a problem with them swelling and hurting due to my arthritis.  
  I used it at night before I went to bed.  The next morning
  I noticed that my feet did not hurt like they normally did and
  I could even tell a difference in the the arthritis in my hands!
  I have used it for a couple of weeks now and can really tell a 
  difference.   It is much better than any over the counter 
  salve I have ever used.  I will differently be buying more. I 
  love this stuff!
