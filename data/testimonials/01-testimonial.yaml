  I tried the Eucalyptus and peppermint bath bomb.
  It dispensed perfectly into the water,
  made the water a pretty green color and was relaxing to my tired muscles.
  My muscles felt cool and warm at the same time.
  It had a great aroma that opened up my nasal passages.
  After my bath I felt relaxed and loose instead of tense.
  It was a great experience!
